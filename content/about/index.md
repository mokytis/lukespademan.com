My name is Luke Spademan. I am 18 years old and am currently in sixth form studying: Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science, Physics.

I am an advocate for open source software and enjoy programming in python and other languages.

As a STEM Ambassador I volunteer at a local codeclub and encourage students to become digital innovators, not just consumers.
