## About Me

My name is Luke Spademan.
I am 18 years old and am currently in sixth form studying: Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science, Physics.

I advocate the use of open source software and enjoy programming in python and other languages.

As a STEM Ambassador I volunteer at a local codeclub and encourage students to become digital innovators, not just consumers.

I am dyslexic.
Many people view dyslexia as being nothing but a disability.

> "Dyslexic minds process information differently.
> Our divergent, lateral thinking has created some of the world's greatest inventions, brands and art.
> Yet dyslexia is still perceived as a disadvantage."

I have found that the resources and information put together by [Made By Dyslexia](http://madebydyslexia.org) to be very enlightening.
