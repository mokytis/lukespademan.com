## About Me

My name is Luke Spademan. I am 18 years old and am currently in sixth form studying: Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science, Physics.

I advocate the use of open source software and enjoy programming in python and other languages.

As a STEM Ambassador I volunteer at a local codeclub and encourage students to become digital innovators, not just consumers.

I am dyslexic.
A lot of people see dyslexia as a disability or disadvantage, but this is not the case.
Here are a couple of video from [Made By Dyslexia](http://madebydyslexia.org) about dyslexia.
