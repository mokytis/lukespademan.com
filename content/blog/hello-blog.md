## What is this

That is a good question.
This is a new website I have created where I will be posting:

* Write ups for projects that I am working on
* Abstracts/notes/slides from talks I have given
* My take on any interesting news in tech or otherwise

## How it is made

This site is generated using the [hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io) with the [Hello Friend NG theme](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) .

## When can I expect updates

I have no idea at the moment.
If I work on anything interesting, or anything notable happens that I want to comment on (that won't fit in a tweet) I am likely to post it here.
Apart from that, don't expect anything to regular.
