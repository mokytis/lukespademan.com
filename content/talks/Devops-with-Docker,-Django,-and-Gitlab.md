## Overview

GitLab doesn't host your git repos, it also allows for continuous integration and deployment. This means that after pushing to the Git repo, your code is tested them deployed automatically.

Using this with Docker allows for fast Python deployments to production.

In this talk I will be showing you how to setup a basic CI/CD with GitLab. We will be making a basic Django project as an example.
