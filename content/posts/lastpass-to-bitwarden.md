# Password Managers

We are constantly being told to use different passwords for every website and that each password should be unique, long, complicated, and not personal to us (i.e. favourite colour).
These sorts of passwords are often hard to remember so many people default to having one or two passwords that they think are secure that they share between their online accounts.
This is less than ideal and where password managers come in.

Most popular password managers have the same / similar basic core functionality.
* Generating new complex passwords
* Storeing these passwords so you don't have to remember them
* Storeing your current passwords
* Filling out login forms for you

This helps us in a few ways.

1. We don't need to worry about our new passwords being guessable by people who know how to use facebook.
This is because they are a (pseudo-)random selection of numbers, symbols, and letters.
2. Forgetting passwords is a thing of the past. Your password manager will remember them for you, so you don't have to.
